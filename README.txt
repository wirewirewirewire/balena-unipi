wsclient test tool usage

Use input params on start
 -d = debug enabled (more logs)
 -c <command> = command to send to unipi. Example: "-c lcoff" possible: lcon = 0% transparency, lcoff= 100% transparency
 -f <loop pause> = lc dimming loop start with <loop pause> as the pause for steps. Higher value -> slower dimming default: "-f 100"
